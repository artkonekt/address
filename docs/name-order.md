# Name Order

Name order is an [enum](https://github.com/artkonekt/enum) and is used
by the [Person](person.md) model.

There are two major types of
[name order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_name#Name_order):
western and eastern.

These two are supported out of the box:

| Type    | Meaning                                                  |
|:--------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
| western | Full name is *given name, family name*; eg. John Smith   |
| eastern | Full name is *family name, given name* eg. Puskás Ferenc |


### Western Order

The order *given name, family name* is commonly known as the Western
order and is usually used in most European countries and in countries
that have cultures predominantly influenced by Western Europe.

### Eastern Order

The order *family name, given name* is commonly known as the Eastern
order and is primarily used in East Asia, parts of India, also in some
European areas.
